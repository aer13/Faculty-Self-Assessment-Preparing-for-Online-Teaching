q9a1 = "You have indicated that you do not use communication tools successfully to keep in touch with your students. Perhaps this is because of a lack of experience with the tools or a lack of time. The easiest way to start interacting with students is via the methods they use to contact you. Most often this will be through email. Other methods may include by phone, online meeting tools, discussion boards, or social media. Most Learning Management Systems include various communication tools. You may want to review the instructions for how to use the tools or ask another faculty member what they use. If time is a factor, you may want to reserve time first thing in the morning or last thing during the day to make sure you take a moment to connect with your students regardless of the tool you choose."
q9a2 = "Sometimes it is hard to find the right mix of tools and methods to communicate with students. Some students may never check their email. Some students may never even log into the course. Most Learning Management Systems have ways to see if a student is interacting with the course. If you are making attempts to communicate and are not getting a response, maybe you should seek an alternative method of communication. Maybe the student prefers a certain mode of communication, or does not understand where to retrieve your communications. This is something you could determine at the beginning of the course. As you may know, sometimes it is difficult to establish a connection at a distance, but there are a variety of tools available. See what is available in your LMS or what other colleagues do. The more ways you have to communicate with your students, the more opportunities you will have to engage and establish a good learning relationship.]]>"

Being able to communicate with students through a variety of tools and modes is essential because of each student's individual preferences and communication styles.

The more ways you can communicate, the greater chance you have of being a successful and effective instructor."
q9a4 = "Excellent! Students want to know that the instructor is available to them through a variety of ways. Your ability to meet them on multiple levels will ensure that they are comfortable in reaching out to you during the course.

Your experience and your attitude make you a great role model for them."

You will need to determine what methods you will want to use, but you also need to consider what methods your students prefer.

Plan to log into the course several times a day to monitor class activity and provide feedback. Because what is communicated online is often written and, in some ways, permanent, higher standards are necessary and an instructor's writing serves as a model (Cummings, 1998). Being able to communicate in a clear and concise manner will make the learning experience more positive for all involved."

As it is one of the primary ways to offer guidance to the student, providing timely, formative, and meaningful feedback is an essential aspect to a successful online course. Think of each graded assignment as a \"teachable moment\" where you help facilitate student understanding and progress.

It also includes recognition of areas the student excelled at and why so they can replicate their great work on similar assignments. To begin integrating this into your teaching, it is recommended that you create a plan for feedback interaction for your course. The plan should ensure that you provide feedback on assignments on a regular basis throughout the semester (formative feedback). It is recommended that faculty set a turnaround time of feedback for assignments and a recommended practice is 5 days. To help set expectations of the instructor this timeframe should be conveyed to students. It is understandable that you may not be able to give the same amount of feedback for all assignments. It is essential to determine which assignments build upon prior assignments and ensure that you provide meaningful, detailed feedback for these key activities.

Posting periodic announcements that remind students of upcoming topics and due dates, as well as any modifications that may have been made to the course, help students progress toward goals and stay on track. It is a best practice to present a weekly announcement at the beginning of each week on a consistent basis. It is recommended that the announcement address important updates towards the beginning of the e-mail/announcement as students may be accustomed to the structure and may not read it in its entirety. It is recommended that the introductory weekly announcement also include an overview of upcoming events and deadlines. A secondary e-mail or announcement summarizing course activities and providing a general reminder to the whole class near the end of the week is a recommended proactive strategy to help students succeed. You may want to consider conducting announcements approximately the same time each week (e.g., Monday afternoon around 1 p.m.) so students can be accustomed to look for this update."
